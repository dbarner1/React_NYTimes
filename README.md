A few notes on the build:
1. Images appear to be formatted incorrectly in the Times API, and if an image doesn't appear, its replaced with a default image.
2. Infinite scrolling is included in the /results page, but is not often needed due to not many results often returning.
3. There are several ways this can be optimized, which I'm happy to discuss!
